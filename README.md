# Ethical-Hacking-Commands-Generator
A static, single-page web utility for generating complex command-line syntax for ethical hacking and security auditing tools.

## 📋 Overview

**CmdGen** is a lightweight, responsive web application designed to help penetration testers, CTF players, and security researchers quickly construct accurate commands for popular security tools. Instead of memorizing obscure flags or constantly checking man pages, users can select a tool, configure parameters via a GUI, and instantly get the production-ready command.

It runs entirely in the browser using vanilla JavaScript and Tailwind CSS. No backend or compilation is required.

## ✨ Features

- **20+ Integrated Tools:** Covers the entire kill chain from Reconnaissance to Exploitation.
    
- **Dynamic Configuration:** Forms adapt based on selected modes (e.g., changing Nmap scan types or Metasploit payloads).
    
- **Real-time Generation:** The terminal preview updates instantly as you type.
    
- **One-Click Copy:** Quickly grab the generated command for your terminal.
    
- **Hacker Aesthetic:** Fully responsive dark mode interface with neon accents.
    
- **Zero Dependencies:** Single HTML file architecture. Just download and run.
